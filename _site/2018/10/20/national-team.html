    <h3 id="gerald-verosil">Gerald Verosil</h3>

    <p><em>Full name: Gerald Verosil<br />
Age: 17 years old<br />
Hometown: Manila, Philippines (now based in Singapore)
Current residence<br />
Gym you started climbing: Onsight Climbing Gym, Singapore</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: I started climbing 4-and-a-half years ago (13 years old)</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What got you into climbing?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: Started climbing because of my two older siblings who climb as well. I also wanted to try something new apart from the typical ball games and challenge myself.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: My favourite part of climbing is the physical and mental challenge it gives me every time I’m on the wall, and also getting to meet new friends from around the world!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: I continue climbing because I have dreams of becoming a World Champion in the future. But ultimately, it’s my passion and desire to get better which drives me day in, day out. Also it’s family! Everyone is a climber so I have to keep up with my equally-passionate siblings!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: The biggest challenge I’ve faced in climbing so far and am still facing, is probably my own self-expectations. Climbing is a lot on mental strength as much as it is on physical. Until today, I often get lost in my own hunger for progress and it sets me back- all the more when I don’t exactly have a coach to guide me. Climbing is always fun, but when things start to get serious (e.g. pursuing a career in climbing), it can really be stressful. I cope by surrounding myself with people who constantly push me and remind me to have fun.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: I love slopers! Among the other hold types, I must say I feel strongest on slopers! Plus, it doesn’t hurt my fingers!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: My favourite type of climbing is Bouldering. Bouldering teaches me a lot about my body and movement, but above all, it helps me feel free and liberated!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: My current goal is to consistently produce results for Team Philippines in all competitions next year. Long term goal will be qualifying for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo! It is my dream.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Gerald</strong>: Being part of an ever-evolving, ever-improving team with lots of potential is definitely a huge honour. As one of the youngest athletes, I am proud to represent the Philippines Climbing Team and be part of this project. Everyone in the team knows we’re underdogs in the international competition scene, but that makes us all the more motivated to achieve great things in this sport for the Philippines.</p>

    <p><em>Name: Iman lorenzo G. Mora<br />
Hometown: Cagayan de Oro City<br />
Age: 29<br />
Occupation: Athlete<br />
Home gym: Viajero Climbing gym</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: I was first introduced to climbing when I was 11 but only got into it in 2010</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What got you into climbing? <br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: My parents at first. Eventually I just fell in love with it on my own.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: The escape it gives and the unexplainable happiness i get from doing it.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why do you keep climbing?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: I keep climbing because I constantly learn new things and always have the urge to keep improving my movement, strength and skill. But mostly because I just love doing it and enjoy every moment I am on an artificial wall or outdoors on real rocks climbing.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: The biggest would be climbing/training without injury, especially because it’s very demanding on the body. I have incorporated warm ups before climbing and stretching after as a must do.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: I love pinches. It used to be one of my weaknesses so I’m really happy to be able to hold on to different kind of pinches now. Fruit of labor thing.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: My favorite type is bouldering. I find it the most fun of all disciplines and can keep doing it all day if I could.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Iman</strong>: My current goal is to stay healthy physically and mentally. It’s hard on us athletes to keep training our bodies and push limits so it’s very important for me to stay healthy and be ready to represent the country at anytime we have an upcoming competition. Also, to finish some projects I have outdoors.</p>

    <p>Send: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?
Iman: I feel honored and at the same time excited to always have a reason to train harder as being part of the team.</p>

    <p><em>Name: Washington Jusay<br />
Hometown: Cavite City<br />
Age: 33<br />
Occupation: Rope Access Technician/Climbing Coach<br />
Home gym:  Power Up Alabang</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>:When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: I started climbing when I was 22.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: I’ve always been athletic, and I’ve tried all kinds of sports. I remember that I was looking for a new sport during that time, this was around 2007. My friends and I were walking inside the mall and we saw a small climbing gym inside this sports shop. We thought it would be interesting to try it out, and as an athlete I’m always up for a challenge. That’s how it all began.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: The best part about climbing is that no matter how strong you get, there will always be a problem or route that will give you a greater challenge. There is always a channel for growth and improvement.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: For me, climbing is not just a hobby, it’s already a part of me. I can’t separate myself from it. If I don’t get to climb, I feel like a part of me is missing. When I climb, my problems and stress go away.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: The biggest challenge I’ve ever had is when I got an injury that prevented me from climbing. Whenever I get injuries, I feel like all my efforts go to waste and I have to start from zero again. Because of this, I learned how to be more efficient and careful when training to prevent injuries.</p>

    <p>Recovering from an injury affects me mentally as well. I need to keep myself motivated to train and not let the injury affect my training habits. If an injury prevents me from climbing, I just do cross training or other sports to keep myself fit until I can go back to climbing again.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: I’d say pinches as they require precision and concentrated power. Slopers, on the other hand, are my eternal downfall. But whether I love or hate them, different holds require different strength and skill. As I’ve said, I like challenging myself.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: I think I’m biased towards bouldering. I love big moves on boulder problems that makes you yell and scream. I like to climb hard on a short route. I like the complicated moves on good holds, weird body positioning, flagging hard, laying back, and big dynos.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: At the moment my goal is to get stronger without getting injured. I also want to pass on my knowledge to my students and to share all the experiences that I have gained through competitions and failures and hopefully, they learn from those too.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Washington</strong>: It feels great as it has always been my dream to be part of the Philippine team. And now that I made it into the team, I’m going to keep training hard and do my best to represent my country well.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: April 2012</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: My friend invited me to climb with him in TS (Power Up Tandang Sora).</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: When I execute movements properly and feel the flow, it’s like dancing on the wall and hard problems feel easy. I love it when a series of moves in a problem feel like one continuous chain of motion.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: Climbing is my passion and way of life. I plan to keep climbing for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: I’ve been trying to gain more experience from competitions and long-term training can be quite challenging. I need to continuously push myself from one training cycle to another, with maybe just a week or a few days of rest in between cycles. I try to push my limits during each training and it helps to focus on my long-term goals to muster enough willpower to persist.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: I like pinches because it requires powerful but smooth movement and body tension.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: Indoor bouldering and outdoor sport climbing, but I like any type of climbing</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: To keep improving myself and push the limits of my capabilities. I want to be the best in this game and I’m working hard to continuously improve.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>John</strong>: I feel honoured to be a part of the Philippine National Climbing Team. It means a lot to me. I hope to make our country proud and this keeps me motivated.</p>

    <p><em>Name: Joanne Ala

Age: 26

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: I started climbing in late 2012.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: I tried it once or twice with friends, pero it really stuck when I was in law school. Like, I had no other way to release my stress. I used to play ultimate frisbee and then all the schedules kasi of training of ultimate are like 8-10pm and I have night class. And then Ces made a general invite; the day she brought me to the gym, she was crushing like the routes, 5.10as, ganon. Tapos nainggit ako, parang wow ang galing ni Ces agad. Sabi ko, sige, but I tried the route, and I couldn’t do it so it made me come back and try it again. The next time I could do it, and then naging addictive na lang sya. So I’ll try something harder and then hindi ko siya magawa so I’ll train and come back and try it again, and then Kuya Mackie came into the picture and he taught me the techniques, made everything easier, and wala, talagang na-addict na lang ako.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: It’s such a different sport, it’s such a diverse sport. Dati yung sports ko were swimming, running, those movements na very repetitive, very boring. When it comes to climbing, different yung movements. There’s no one same move, and every route is different. You also use your mind. So I think my favorite part of it is that it’s so different and when I’m climbing, my mind just goes blank. And then nothing else matters, just the climb.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: It’s fun! I love the sport, I love climbing. Parang that’s the root of everything, when people ask me why I do it. Because I love climbing.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: I was generally an outdoor climber since two or three years ago, and then I turned competition and I sucked. My first international competition, I did so bad, and I remember almost crying to Tito Miel because it was really bad. And then doon ko na-realize na okay, I’ve been sticking to my comfort zone for the longest time, which was outdoor climbing. My biggest challenge was getting into competition climbing, because it’s so different, you have to have completely different mindset, it’s very emotional, it’s very tiring. And there’s so much pressure, especially if you’re national team, people expect you to perform, sponsors expect you to do well, so you have to keep in mind din your sponsors and the support of the community. Competition climbing talaga is a challenge but slowly and steadily, I’m getting there, I’m getting my rhythm of competition climbing, learning how to mentally train. Because physically, I don’t think it’s a problem, like it’s easy to train your physical side, it’s the mental which really gets to you.  Imagine trying to climb in front of a crowd that’s cheering. It will really get to you, and you can’t help it but sometimes you choke. But I’m learning to get over it, I’m learning to steadily relax my mind.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: I like crimps, I love crimps, like I could rest on a crimp. I have really strong finger strength. I remember I was doing hangboards, and Kuya Mackie told me, like “wag ka muna mag weights until naka-two years ka ng climb.” On my second year, sakto, I started doing weights, and I think that really helped me, hanging with weights. That really helped my fingers get strong, and now crimps are like a jug to me.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: Lead climbing, outdoor, on real rock.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: right now I’m aiming to strengthen all of my weaknesses. After every competition you realize what your weakness is because the problems always vary and sometimes, one problem will determine whether or not you make it to finals or semis. Usually, that problem is the problem which you’re weakest on. Right now I’m focusing on strengthening my weaknesses and strengthening my mental game.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Jo</strong>: It’s a very humbling experience. People think na it’s like, glitz and glamour, but no, it’s really really hard work. You have to balance training, you have to balance fundraising, because we don’t have any support from the government. I also manage the team. It’s very humbling because when you’re put against people abroad, you realize, okay, you may be one of the best in the Philippines, but you’re so far from everyone else in the world. But it makes me want to train harder, makes me want to push myself.</p>

    <p><em>Name: Liana Nicole G. Mora<br />
Hometown: Cagayan de Oro City<br />
Age: 28<br />
Occupation: Climber/Athlete<br />
Home gym: Viajero 2000</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: It was a family bonding thing then I got interested and competitive with the sport. Sadly I had to stop because it was too far from where I lived. I started again in college, at Power Up climbing gym, Tandang Sora.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: When I climb I constantly challenge myself and my capabilities. It’s not a competition against other people. For me, it’s a competition against myself and my limitations. Every time I exceed my limits, I feel successful and happy.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: I climb because I feel comfortable with the sport. I feel that my brain and my physical capabilities are constantly being pushed and I like the challenge.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: Last June 2018 I had a competition in Thailand. It was the Asian Cup. Two weeks before the competition, I had a really bad fall and my heel was injured. I couldn’t walk properly and I could not put weight on my foot. I had to use crutches for a week and a cane for the next week. I left the Philippines with an injury. My brother aided me in getting to Thailand. Despite my injury I still competed. I had lesser expectations and I just wanted to enjoy my climb, despite the injury. I was more careful with my movements and my falls to avoid landing on my heel. This was the worst injury I had. But because of this, I was more focused and I carefully planned all my movements. I was not pressured to win, I was not stressed out. This enabled me to realize all the emotions that restrained my previous performances. At the last route, my heel was very painful. I still went on until the last second. When the buzzer rang I asked my brother to carry me to a seat because it was too painful to walk on. Despite this, I was able to finish 8th place in this competition. I was happy with the result. I did not expect to land so high being injured.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: Crimps, because they are friendly to me. I have small hands and can hold tiny holds. I think my fingers are quite strong as well because of the tiny holds.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: I used to like lead climbing but because of the limited facilities and outdoor sport climbing in the city I was forced to focus on bouldering. But bouldering is also awesome.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: My goal is to develop the climbing community in my city and train kids to love the sport. I also want to continue being part of the Philippine National team and experience different types of competitions while representing my country.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Liana</strong>: I feel honored and privileged. It has opened so many doors of opportunity for me. I also am glad that I am in the team with my brother. It makes the journey less lonely because we’re both from the province.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: June 2015</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: My friend, Shamir, invited us to climb at Power Up kasi instructor siya doon before. When we (Brandon and Chelle) tried it, we enjoyed it and sabi ko “tara, balik tayo,” and yun na, tuloy-tuloy na.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: It’s a full body workout for me, so I think yun yung pinaka-gusto ko sa kanya. It keeps me healthy and active. Of course, I get to see my friends, and you know, have fun and work out at the same time.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: In climbing for me, it’s always challenging. There’s always something new to try, there’s always something to do, something to beat. You always have to go beyond what you can do. It’s never ending, it’s always challenging.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: Siguro lead outdoors, because I’m afraid of heights. For me, it takes time and practice to overcome the fear of falling, doon ako natatakot eh. Sa outdoor, siguro pinupush ko lang yung sarili ko to finish the route, to try it and not to be scared, kahit na takot na takot ako. Ayun minsan, umiiyak ako. You just have to take the risk of falling and falling and falling hanggang masanay ka and ma-psyche mo sarili mo na it’s okay to fall.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: Jugs.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: Bouldering. I have a fear of heights, so bouldering for me, sakto lang yung height niya. Also, you can explore different types of movement in bouldering.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: For now, to focus on training, to focus on getting stronger, and to inspire din, since I’m part of the Philippine team. Long term goal, I hope someday I can also make the Philippines proud by winning a competition as prestigious as Asian Cup or Asian Championships. Someday, hopefully.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Rochelle</strong>: Of course I feel proud, I feel thankful. I feel proud kasi not everyone gets to be in this position and gets to be in the Philippine team, so I’m really happy kasi in spite of my experience, nakapasok ako sa team</p>

    <h3 id="juvelle-pua">Juvelle Pua</h3>

    <p><em>Name: Juvelle Pua<br />
Hometown: Baybay, Leyte<br />
Age: 29<br />
Occupation: Full time climber <br />
Home gym: Power Up Tandang Sora</em></p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>:  3 years ago.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: Since I was 5 years old, I loved climbing trees, roofs, windows and anything I see that is potentially climbable. Even as an adult, when my hubby and I are on vacation, no mather on an island or in the mountains, I would look for trees to climb. I didn’t know that there was indoor climbing and that climbing was a sport until a friend took us to Power Up Tandang Sora three years ago. Since then, I haven’t stopped climbing (indoors and outdoors)</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: The intensity, community and never-ending learning process. It’s my way of life. I just don’t see myself doing anything else.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>:  What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: My love of the outdoors and climbing are endless. Climbing gives me clarity and freedom and a chance to discover a new country and its people through its rock and indoor climbing. That’s pretty cool!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: Mental game during competition has been a challenge. Because I generally seek quiet places like when climbing outdoors, I haven’t been exposed to crowds. I also never competed individually growing up (did a bit of volleyball in HS). Comps are new to me. I had to overcome numerous mental challenges. So I decided to fix this by reading a few “mental game” books and watching videos and I would try to practice what I had learned during my training sessions. As a result of this, my anxiety has lessened and am able to control it. It’s getting better after each competition.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: Initially, I loved crimps. Indoors, outdoors, give me crimps! But when I started training, I was exposed to more different types of holds and I started to enjoy them all. I get really excited if I discover a new type of hold. So my answer is I like all types of holds!</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: Tough question…I can’t just pick one. I really enjoy all types of climbing, be it lead, bouldering or speed. I really want to try more trad or even ice climbing.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What are your current goals now?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: To be able to represent the Philippines in the 2020 Olympics and inspire Filipinas to go for their dreams and climb even harder.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?<br />
<strong>Juvelle</strong>: It’s awesome because it allows me to represent the PH and compete with the best which is one of my goals.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: When did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Erika</strong>: Probably around two years after graduating college.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: Why did you start climbing?<br />
<strong>Erika</strong>: It started out as a fun activity with friends. Somehow, I was drawn to the walls every time I get to visit the gym.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite part about climbing?<br />
<strong>Erika</strong>: Learning new techniques while climbing sport climbing routes or boulder problems; the problem solving part.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What keeps you going?<br />
<strong>Erika</strong>:  In climbing, there is always something new to try or work on. Even during frustrating times, I learn to focus and find ways to progress.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?<br />
<strong>Erika</strong>: My biggest challenge is the mental training, which is still something I’m working to this day. I easily get sucked into hesitation during hard moves. The ongoing solution to this remains to be—“keep on climbing”.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why? <br />
<strong>Erika</strong>: Crimps. Small but terrible, hehe.</p>

    <p><strong>Send</strong>: What is your favorite type of climbing?<br />
