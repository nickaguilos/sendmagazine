	Without the support of a community, a climbing gym will slowly deteriorate and find itself closing doors. 
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climbing gyms and communities. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are words that go well together– like chalk bag and chalk balls, fries and ketchup, Lone Ranger and Tonto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By its very nature, climbing is a social sport. We head to the crags and gyms accompanied by the best of our friends who double as our belayers, moral supporters, and drinking buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We create a community of people who share the same passions and interests, one that goes beyond past gym operation hours, and even after the crash pads and rope have been stored and put away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-row 2 medium&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the support of a community, a climbing gym will slowly deteriorate and find itself closing doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall a conversation with Jezrel Soriaso, fondly called Papsy, who is one of the owners of the gym saying that the facility was in a slump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power Up Rock Outdoor Center was struggling to grow it’s community.
This took me by surprise as Adventure Central, a gym just across the channel, was thriving and welcomed a sheer number of climbers on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Bacolod’s climbers rallied together to bring attention to its gym that had become their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early December of 2018, I flew to the City of Smiles to witness Power Up ROC’s Vertical Smiles Climbing Competition, the first climbing event the gym hosted in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-row 2 medium&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the competition, Zai Barrido served as the point person for the event. She explains that the objective of the gym was to expose climbing to a wider audience in Bacolod, and in effect, bring more climbers into the gym. Setting up the competition  was no easy task. She recalls the hurdles they had to go through to get this event up and running: sponsorships, logistics, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A captivating trait the pinoy climbing community shares is its ability to support each other,  giving wholeheartedly without expecting anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition resulted to an overwhelming turnout. 64 participants registered for the event, many of those who had, did so to support and had no intention in competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attendance was a large contingent from Iloilo, mostly comprised by their junior climbers. Also present were climbers from Cebu and Dumaguete, and even as far as Manila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vertical Smiles lasted way into the night and was capped with food, drinks, and conversations exchanged with familiar faces and new friends. Comps are 50% athleticism and 50% gatherings after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an event that bore much fruit. Zai mentioned that proceeds from the competition would be used to fund the wall repainting jobs, purchasing of new holds, and community funds for new climbing hardware.
Moreso, the competition breathed new life into an aging climbing gym in the Visayas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/vertical-smiles/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot; Vertical Smiles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it has become standard to say an event was a success, even if the reality was otherwise. This time around it definitely was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chalk it up, this gym is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;gerald-verosil&quot;&gt;Gerald Verosil&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full name: Gerald Verosil&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 17 years old&lt;br /&gt;
Hometown: Manila, Philippines (now based in Singapore)
Current residence&lt;br /&gt;
Gym you started climbing: Onsight Climbing Gym, Singapore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: I started climbing 4-and-a-half years ago (13 years old)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What got you into climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: Started climbing because of my two older siblings who climb as well. I also wanted to try something new apart from the typical ball games and challenge myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: My favourite part of climbing is the physical and mental challenge it gives me every time I’m on the wall, and also getting to meet new friends from around the world!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: I continue climbing because I have dreams of becoming a World Champion in the future. But ultimately, it’s my passion and desire to get better which drives me day in, day out. Also it’s family! Everyone is a climber so I have to keep up with my equally-passionate siblings!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: The biggest challenge I’ve faced in climbing so far and am still facing, is probably my own self-expectations. Climbing is a lot on mental strength as much as it is on physical. Until today, I often get lost in my own hunger for progress and it sets me back- all the more when I don’t exactly have a coach to guide me. Climbing is always fun, but when things start to get serious (e.g. pursuing a career in climbing), it can really be stressful. I cope by surrounding myself with people who constantly push me and remind me to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: I love slopers! Among the other hold types, I must say I feel strongest on slopers! Plus, it doesn’t hurt my fingers!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: My favourite type of climbing is Bouldering. Bouldering teaches me a lot about my body and movement, but above all, it helps me feel free and liberated!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: My current goal is to consistently produce results for Team Philippines in all competitions next year. Long term goal will be qualifying for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo! It is my dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Gerald&lt;/strong&gt;: Being part of an ever-evolving, ever-improving team with lots of potential is definitely a huge honour. As one of the youngest athletes, I am proud to represent the Philippines Climbing Team and be part of this project. Everyone in the team knows we’re underdogs in the international competition scene, but that makes us all the more motivated to achieve great things in this sport for the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

Age: 29&lt;br /&gt;
Occupation: Athlete&lt;br /&gt;
Home gym: Viajero Climbing gym&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: I was first introduced to climbing when I was 11 but only got into it in 2010&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What got you into climbing? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: My parents at first. Eventually I just fell in love with it on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: The escape it gives and the unexplainable happiness i get from doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why do you keep climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: I keep climbing because I constantly learn new things and always have the urge to keep improving my movement, strength and skill. But mostly because I just love doing it and enjoy every moment I am on an artificial wall or outdoors on real rocks climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: The biggest would be climbing/training without injury, especially because it’s very demanding on the body. I have incorporated warm ups before climbing and stretching after as a must do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: I love pinches. It used to be one of my weaknesses so I’m really happy to be able to hold on to different kind of pinches now. Fruit of labor thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite type is bouldering. I find it the most fun of all disciplines and can keep doing it all day if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iman&lt;/strong&gt;: My current goal is to stay healthy physically and mentally. It’s hard on us athletes to keep training our bodies and push limits so it’s very important for me to stay healthy and be ready to represent the country at anytime we have an upcoming competition. Also, to finish some projects I have outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Send: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?
Iman: I feel honored and at the same time excited to always have a reason to train harder as being part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

Hometown: Cavite City&lt;br /&gt;
Age: 33&lt;br /&gt;
Occupation: Rope Access Technician/Climbing Coach&lt;br /&gt;
Home gym:  Power Up Alabang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;:When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: I started climbing when I was 22.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve always been athletic, and I’ve tried all kinds of sports. I remember that I was looking for a new sport during that time, this was around 2007. My friends and I were walking inside the mall and we saw a small climbing gym inside this sports shop. We thought it would be interesting to try it out, and as an athlete I’m always up for a challenge. That’s how it all began.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: The best part about climbing is that no matter how strong you get, there will always be a problem or route that will give you a greater challenge. There is always a channel for growth and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: For me, climbing is not just a hobby, it’s already a part of me. I can’t separate myself from it. If I don’t get to climb, I feel like a part of me is missing. When I climb, my problems and stress go away.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: The biggest challenge I’ve ever had is when I got an injury that prevented me from climbing. Whenever I get injuries, I feel like all my efforts go to waste and I have to start from zero again. Because of this, I learned how to be more efficient and careful when training to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Recovering from an injury affects me mentally as well. I need to keep myself motivated to train and not let the injury affect my training habits. If an injury prevents me from climbing, I just do cross training or other sports to keep myself fit until I can go back to climbing again.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: I’d say pinches as they require precision and concentrated power. Slopers, on the other hand, are my eternal downfall. But whether I love or hate them, different holds require different strength and skill. As I’ve said, I like challenging myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: I think I’m biased towards bouldering. I love big moves on boulder problems that makes you yell and scream. I like to climb hard on a short route. I like the complicated moves on good holds, weird body positioning, flagging hard, laying back, and big dynos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: At the moment my goal is to get stronger without getting injured. I also want to pass on my knowledge to my students and to share all the experiences that I have gained through competitions and failures and hopefully, they learn from those too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Washington&lt;/strong&gt;: It feels great as it has always been my dream to be part of the Philippine team. And now that I made it into the team, I’m going to keep training hard and do my best to represent my country well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: April 2012&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: My friend invited me to climb with him in TS (Power Up Tandang Sora).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: When I execute movements properly and feel the flow, it’s like dancing on the wall and hard problems feel easy. I love it when a series of moves in a problem feel like one continuous chain of motion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: Climbing is my passion and way of life. I plan to keep climbing for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve been trying to gain more experience from competitions and long-term training can be quite challenging. I need to continuously push myself from one training cycle to another, with maybe just a week or a few days of rest in between cycles. I try to push my limits during each training and it helps to focus on my long-term goals to muster enough willpower to persist.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: I like pinches because it requires powerful but smooth movement and body tension.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: Indoor bouldering and outdoor sport climbing, but I like any type of climbing&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: To keep improving myself and push the limits of my capabilities. I want to be the best in this game and I’m working hard to continuously improve.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel honoured to be a part of the Philippine National Climbing Team. It means a lot to me. I hope to make our country proud and this keeps me motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Ininvite lang ako ni Rochelle tapos tinry lang namin. Nakakatawa nga doon, eh kasi may isang area doon na hindi ko natapos pero siya natapos niya, hanggat sa binalikan namin nang binalikan ‘tas hanggang sa na-hook na kami sa climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Yung culture, yung mga tao- friendly, tapos masaya kasama. Mas masaya sa climbing kaysa sa ibang sport, yung bond mas iba.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Noong dati kasi, nag-start kami, nag-set kami ng goal na kapag makapasa kami sa Philippine Team, okay. Tapos dati nung di pa kami kasama sa team, yung ginoal lang namin ay makapag-compete sa open international comps, para lang makasama. Tapos, yun na, yun na nag start.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Yung pag balance ng work at ng climbing, medyo challenging siya sa una. Pero, kasi ginagawa ko na lang na nag-schedule schedule na lang ako nang maayos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Jug kasi madali mag-hang.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: More on winning eh, saka tumaas yung grade namin sa climbing. Saka mas maganda, gusto namin manalo kami sa comp saka makatapos kami ng hard routes para mainspire yung ibang tao, lalo na mga beginners. Gusto namin na ma-inspire sila na mag-climb pa at mag-train din sila, para yung mga goals nila, makuha nila.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brandon&lt;/strong&gt;: Masaya! Kasi may training saka nakikilala namin yung ibang tao eh, like hindi lang yung dito sa Philippines, pati yung sa abroad nakakausap namin. Saka yung mga idol namin sa IFSC nakikita rin namin, nakaka-picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Mhik&lt;/strong&gt;: I started climbing in the University, P.E. class&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mhik&lt;/strong&gt;: Learning never stops. [It’s an] unending process, you get stronger and stronger every time you climb as well. You also get to meet other climbers from other parts of the country and outside and learn from them also.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mhik&lt;/strong&gt;: [It’s] my stress reliever  I also enjoy the company. Gusto ko rin ma-overcome fear ko sa heights and makakuha ng gold sa international competitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Mhik&lt;/strong&gt;: Competing on speed kahit walang practice masyado. I almost gave up dahil nahihiya ako sa bagal ko mag climb, but nilaban ko lang and [I] pushed myself. Nagawa ko naman bumilis kahit papano.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: I started climbing in late 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: I tried it once or twice with friends, pero it really stuck when I was in law school. Like, I had no other way to release my stress. I used to play ultimate frisbee and then all the schedules kasi of training of ultimate are like 8-10pm and I have night class. And then Ces made a general invite; the day she brought me to the gym, she was crushing like the routes, 5.10as, ganon. Tapos nainggit ako, parang wow ang galing ni Ces agad. Sabi ko, sige, but I tried the route, and I couldn’t do it so it made me come back and try it again. The next time I could do it, and then naging addictive na lang sya. So I’ll try something harder and then hindi ko siya magawa so I’ll train and come back and try it again, and then Kuya Mackie came into the picture and he taught me the techniques, made everything easier, and wala, talagang na-addict na lang ako.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s such a different sport, it’s such a diverse sport. Dati yung sports ko were swimming, running, those movements na very repetitive, very boring. When it comes to climbing, different yung movements. There’s no one same move, and every route is different. You also use your mind. So I think my favorite part of it is that it’s so different and when I’m climbing, my mind just goes blank. And then nothing else matters, just the climb.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s fun! I love the sport, I love climbing. Parang that’s the root of everything, when people ask me why I do it. Because I love climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: I was generally an outdoor climber since two or three years ago, and then I turned competition and I sucked. My first international competition, I did so bad, and I remember almost crying to Tito Miel because it was really bad. And then doon ko na-realize na okay, I’ve been sticking to my comfort zone for the longest time, which was outdoor climbing. My biggest challenge was getting into competition climbing, because it’s so different, you have to have completely different mindset, it’s very emotional, it’s very tiring. And there’s so much pressure, especially if you’re national team, people expect you to perform, sponsors expect you to do well, so you have to keep in mind din your sponsors and the support of the community. Competition climbing talaga is a challenge but slowly and steadily, I’m getting there, I’m getting my rhythm of competition climbing, learning how to mentally train. Because physically, I don’t think it’s a problem, like it’s easy to train your physical side, it’s the mental which really gets to you.  Imagine trying to climb in front of a crowd that’s cheering. It will really get to you, and you can’t help it but sometimes you choke. But I’m learning to get over it, I’m learning to steadily relax my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: I like crimps, I love crimps, like I could rest on a crimp. I have really strong finger strength. I remember I was doing hangboards, and Kuya Mackie told me, like “wag ka muna mag weights until naka-two years ka ng climb.” On my second year, sakto, I started doing weights, and I think that really helped me, hanging with weights. That really helped my fingers get strong, and now crimps are like a jug to me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: Lead climbing, outdoor, on real rock.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: right now I’m aiming to strengthen all of my weaknesses. After every competition you realize what your weakness is because the problems always vary and sometimes, one problem will determine whether or not you make it to finals or semis. Usually, that problem is the problem which you’re weakest on. Right now I’m focusing on strengthening my weaknesses and strengthening my mental game.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a very humbling experience. People think na it’s like, glitz and glamour, but no, it’s really really hard work. You have to balance training, you have to balance fundraising, because we don’t have any support from the government. I also manage the team. It’s very humbling because when you’re put against people abroad, you realize, okay, you may be one of the best in the Philippines, but you’re so far from everyone else in the world. But it makes me want to train harder, makes me want to push myself.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: It was a family bonding thing then I got interested and competitive with the sport. Sadly I had to stop because it was too far from where I lived. I started again in college, at Power Up climbing gym, Tandang Sora.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: When I climb I constantly challenge myself and my capabilities. It’s not a competition against other people. For me, it’s a competition against myself and my limitations. Every time I exceed my limits, I feel successful and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: I climb because I feel comfortable with the sport. I feel that my brain and my physical capabilities are constantly being pushed and I like the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: Last June 2018 I had a competition in Thailand. It was the Asian Cup. Two weeks before the competition, I had a really bad fall and my heel was injured. I couldn’t walk properly and I could not put weight on my foot. I had to use crutches for a week and a cane for the next week. I left the Philippines with an injury. My brother aided me in getting to Thailand. Despite my injury I still competed. I had lesser expectations and I just wanted to enjoy my climb, despite the injury. I was more careful with my movements and my falls to avoid landing on my heel. This was the worst injury I had. But because of this, I was more focused and I carefully planned all my movements. I was not pressured to win, I was not stressed out. This enabled me to realize all the emotions that restrained my previous performances. At the last route, my heel was very painful. I still went on until the last second. When the buzzer rang I asked my brother to carry me to a seat because it was too painful to walk on. Despite this, I was able to finish 8th place in this competition. I was happy with the result. I did not expect to land so high being injured.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: Crimps, because they are friendly to me. I have small hands and can hold tiny holds. I think my fingers are quite strong as well because of the tiny holds.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: I used to like lead climbing but because of the limited facilities and outdoor sport climbing in the city I was forced to focus on bouldering. But bouldering is also awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: My goal is to develop the climbing community in my city and train kids to love the sport. I also want to continue being part of the Philippine National team and experience different types of competitions while representing my country.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Liana&lt;/strong&gt;: I feel honored and privileged. It has opened so many doors of opportunity for me. I also am glad that I am in the team with my brother. It makes the journey less lonely because we’re both from the province.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: My friend, Shamir, invited us to climb at Power Up kasi instructor siya doon before. When we (Brandon and Chelle) tried it, we enjoyed it and sabi ko “tara, balik tayo,” and yun na, tuloy-tuloy na.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a full body workout for me, so I think yun yung pinaka-gusto ko sa kanya. It keeps me healthy and active. Of course, I get to see my friends, and you know, have fun and work out at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: In climbing for me, it’s always challenging. There’s always something new to try, there’s always something to do, something to beat. You always have to go beyond what you can do. It’s never ending, it’s always challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Siguro lead outdoors, because I’m afraid of heights. For me, it takes time and practice to overcome the fear of falling, doon ako natatakot eh. Sa outdoor, siguro pinupush ko lang yung sarili ko to finish the route, to try it and not to be scared, kahit na takot na takot ako. Ayun minsan, umiiyak ako. You just have to take the risk of falling and falling and falling hanggang masanay ka and ma-psyche mo sarili mo na it’s okay to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Bouldering. I have a fear of heights, so bouldering for me, sakto lang yung height niya. Also, you can explore different types of movement in bouldering.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: For now, to focus on training, to focus on getting stronger, and to inspire din, since I’m part of the Philippine team. Long term goal, I hope someday I can also make the Philippines proud by winning a competition as prestigious as Asian Cup or Asian Championships. Someday, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Rochelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course I feel proud, I feel thankful. I feel proud kasi not everyone gets to be in this position and gets to be in the Philippine team, so I’m really happy kasi in spite of my experience, nakapasok ako sa team&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;:  3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Since I was 5 years old, I loved climbing trees, roofs, windows and anything I see that is potentially climbable. Even as an adult, when my hubby and I are on vacation, no mather on an island or in the mountains, I would look for trees to climb. I didn’t know that there was indoor climbing and that climbing was a sport until a friend took us to Power Up Tandang Sora three years ago. Since then, I haven’t stopped climbing (indoors and outdoors)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: The intensity, community and never-ending learning process. It’s my way of life. I just don’t see myself doing anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;:  What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: My love of the outdoors and climbing are endless. Climbing gives me clarity and freedom and a chance to discover a new country and its people through its rock and indoor climbing. That’s pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Mental game during competition has been a challenge. Because I generally seek quiet places like when climbing outdoors, I haven’t been exposed to crowds. I also never competed individually growing up (did a bit of volleyball in HS). Comps are new to me. I had to overcome numerous mental challenges. So I decided to fix this by reading a few “mental game” books and watching videos and I would try to practice what I had learned during my training sessions. As a result of this, my anxiety has lessened and am able to control it. It’s getting better after each competition.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Initially, I loved crimps. Indoors, outdoors, give me crimps! But when I started training, I was exposed to more different types of holds and I started to enjoy them all. I get really excited if I discover a new type of hold. So my answer is I like all types of holds!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: Tough question…I can’t just pick one. I really enjoy all types of climbing, be it lead, bouldering or speed. I really want to try more trad or even ice climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: To be able to represent the Philippines in the 2020 Olympics and inspire Filipinas to go for their dreams and climb even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Juvelle&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s awesome because it allows me to represent the PH and compete with the best which is one of my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: Probably around two years after graduating college.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you start climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: It started out as a fun activity with friends. Somehow, I was drawn to the walls every time I get to visit the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite part about climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: Learning new techniques while climbing sport climbing routes or boulder problems; the problem solving part.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What keeps you going?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;:  In climbing, there is always something new to try or work on. Even during frustrating times, I learn to focus and find ways to progress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the biggest climbing related challenge you’ve faced and how did you overcome this?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: My biggest challenge is the mental training, which is still something I’m working to this day. I easily get sucked into hesitation during hard moves. The ongoing solution to this remains to be—“keep on climbing”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s your favorite kind of hold and why? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: Crimps. Small but terrible, hehe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What is your favorite type of climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: I enjoy sport climbing. I like its steady pace, it gets me into this focused mode.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your current goals now?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: Strengthen to climb harder routes! Also work on dynos.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How does it feel to be part of the national climbing team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Erika&lt;/strong&gt;: Both proud and blessed. I am learning a lot training from my teammates, and I hope to bring out the best that I can to represent the flag.&lt;/p&gt;

	In this second edition of &lt;em&gt;What's In Your Bag&lt;/em&gt;, we peered inside &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Robles&lt;/strong&gt;' climbing bag. 
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught up with him at the gym after a day trip at Montalban, Rizal, and he showed us just what kind of stuff he brings outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;North Face Duffel Bag Medium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;north-face-duffel-bag-in-medium&quot;&gt;North Face Duffel Bag in Medium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I got it because it’s the biggest size that I can bring [as a] hand carry&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How long have you had it for?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Around two years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s mostly your crag bag?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, because it’s comfortable and it’s really easy to get stuff out of it. I used to hike and mountaineering bags tend to be narrow so you need to dig in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How often do you go on [climbing] trips?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: This year, as much as possible but it depends on the season. During the rainy season, it was hard to get out. When the rain stopped, I tried to go almost every week, every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you make sure to always carry when you go outdoors?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Okay, let’s start from most important to least important.   Most important, shoes. I have two pairs of shoes for lead climbing because I have a loose pair which is just for warming up and endurance routes. Then I have an aggressive pair for projects or redpointing. So, two pairs of shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Climbing Shoes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shoes&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your shoes?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: [The] loose pair is Climb X, I don’t know what model. But I got this when there were no other shoes available a few years ago. It’s not anything special, it’s just like a workhorse na shoe. The other shoe is my favorite shoe, it’s a 5.10 Arrowhead. It’s pretty aggressive. Actually pinabili ko ‘to sa Canada on sale and I bought two pairs kasi nag sale siya and at the same time, [it was phased] out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How long have you had that pair?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘Yung original pair, mga two years [old], and then the new one, I got it middle of this year lang (note: this interview was conducted in 2018).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh, so that’s a new pair?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the new one. Then I have one that’s mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: You don’t use the first pair anymore?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: No because I wanna have it resoled, and if you use it too much then it’s harder to resole pag nabutas na yung taas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why do you like the 5.10 Arrowhead?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a really good fit for me. It’s aggressive but it’s stiff. I’ve had other aggressive shoes na parang ang nipis, like yung Scarpa Boostic or Booster S. I can’t put any power down. This one is stiff enough that it gives you power but toe down so [it’s] aggressive. Good for edging, and good for precision. And then the heel fits really well also, it doesn’t come off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chalk Bag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lime-chalk-bag&quot;&gt;Lime Chalk Bag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I have my lime chalk bag. I changed the strap to a cord. It’s more for emergencies. If I need to anchor or if I need a prusik in the middle of the climb then I can just take off the chalk bag and use the cord for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you ever have to use the cord?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: So far, not yet. The disadvantage lang is a few times during a climb natatanggal sya because I didn’t knot it properly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: It fell?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. Like in the middle of a hard climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Climbing Harness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-diamond-momentum&quot;&gt;Black Diamond Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: My harness is overdue. I have to replace it this year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: When do you say that you want to replace it? Does it feel or look different?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually the manufacturer says five years. It depends on the manufacturer, but usually five years ung shelf life nya even if you’re not using it. And it’s also starting to rust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: When I bought this, I was just starting to get back into climbing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: You stopped climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I started again mga three and a half years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: So, how long have you been climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I started in 1998, so 20 years [ago]. I was around 11.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why did you stop?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot of reasons. I never really stop stopped, like I would still climb every so often but I didn’t take it seriously. For a while, medyo nag decline ung climbing in general, like they stopped having competitions. I started competing really early- if I started climbing at 11, I started competing at 12, so competitions were all that I knew before, and then hindi naman uso mag outdoor dati kung hindi ka mountaineer or hardcore. It (climbing outdoors) wasn’t as accessible before. So when the competitions stopped, I lost my motivation. At the same time even when they were still going, I wasn’t winning. I wasn’t on the trajectory that I wanted to be. I would get third place, second place sa nationals when I was like 17. But then, for a long time after that, I wouldn’t progress- I’ve never gotten first place sa nationals.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: So that discouraged you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: That, and the fact that [the competitions became less and less]. So before, we used to have three or four national competitions a year, and then it became one a year and then it became one every other year. So not only was I not winning, but at the same time, it was harder and harder to win because you get fewer opportunities. So I stopped and then I got into mountaineering and focused on school.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How long did you stop?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Around six years. I mean, I never really stopped but I stopped being competitive. I’m not competitive now but now I have other motivations na competitive in the sense of climbing hard, competitive against myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coffee&quot;&gt;Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Back to your stuff- what’s the next one that you find is an essential for you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;. Always have coffee. I was gonna say belay device, but pwede namang humiram ng belay device. It’s really hard to climb without coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/5a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nalgene&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nalgene&quot;&gt;Nalgene&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I usually bring one liter for a day trip because I also have coffee, but if I didn’t have the coffee then I’d probably need more water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aid&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-aid-kit&quot;&gt;First Aid Kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: In terms of priority, I also always usually have a first aid kit. It contains various medicine, hydrite, alcohol. It’s actually a first aid slash kikay kit. There’s sunblock and Off [lotion] and then nail cutter, scissors, Betadyne, bandages, lighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Belay Device&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belay-device-mega-jul&quot;&gt;Belay Device (Mega Jul)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: So far it’s the most versatile belay device because it’s assisted belay, but it’s also a tube device. It’s an assisted belay device and at the same time pwede ka mag double rope rappel. It’s not perfect for rappelling, but it works. Usually, when you rappel, you can’t let go of your brake line otherwise [you’ll fall]. So with this one, it still works as an assisted braking device while you’re rappelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Personal Anchor System&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metolius-personal-anchor-system&quot;&gt;Metolius Personal Anchor System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s also very useful and versatile because each loop is supposed to be as strong as your belay loop. It’s stronger than a daisy chain, basically. More reliable. And even if you only have one anchored, then it’s supposed to be good enough not like daisy chain or sling na dapat dalawa o tatlo. So this one, you can use the same chain and then anchor it on two points and it’ll be strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you use that for?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: On a normal crag day, usually for retrieving but also it’s good for multi-pitch, it’s good for routesetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quickdraws&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quickdraws&quot;&gt;Quickdraws&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I came from monkey wall so I brought all 22 quickdraws&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: 22!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, because the routes are really long there. And then I have a set of 10 that are really really old so I replaced the runners. I’ve had these for 10 years but I bought them second hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-north-face-hat&quot;&gt;The North Face Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Monkey wall is a really sunny crag so it’s nice to have  a wide brim hat. Even if you try to avoid the sun, minsan you can’t avoid the climbing day extending, so it’s useful if you really have to belay under the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thermarest&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thermarest&quot;&gt;Thermarest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Thermarest because I’m old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: What’s a thermarest?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s an inflatable mat. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Like a banana boat?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Not that inflatable, it stays flat, but it has a little air cushion. It’s just for lying down or sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TrailFood&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually, I bring dried mangoes or dried fruits. My favorite is actually dried mango plus dried cranberries- I mix them together. Sometimes I cut it up so that it mixes really well. Cranberries are sour and the dried mangoes are sweet so it’s a nice combination. So geeky. Mixed nuts are also nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Belay Glasses&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belay-glasses&quot;&gt;Belay Glasses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Belay glasses because I’m old. [If you wear these], you don’t have to look up. You can belay without straining your neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: How long have you had your belay glasses for?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: This year lang. Around May, we went to Canada so I bought a bunch of stuff. I bought the thermarest, I bought the belay glasses, stuff for old people. Stuff for comfort because I’m old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re not that old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: And trekking poles.. I bought, like, for my knees. Because I’m old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: You bring trekking poles?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, if I’m going far or if I have a heavy bag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: But not for climbing?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes, yeah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Because you’re old?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: Because I’m old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Speakers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;speakers&quot;&gt;Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I always bring them but I don’t always play music because nahihiya ako minsan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: I dunno. When other people have music, I ask them if they wanna play their music before I play mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bean&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bean&quot;&gt;Bean&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you always bring Bean along when you climb?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dru&lt;/strong&gt;: As much as possible, we don’t like to leave him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
	What’s in your bag? is a recurring feature where we ask climbers to tell us a bit more about the items they use in their climbs by opening their bags and themselves to us.

	At Global Climbing Day, we revisit the age-old itch of scaling great heights
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While climbing is a relatively new sport, the urge to climb is a tale as old as time. It’s a pull so strong that it’s driven people to make some seemingly crazy life choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex Honnold, one of the most esteemed free climbers today, is basically homeless. He lives in a van and spends his time driving to different formations of rock. Tommy Caldwell sawed his left index finger off (accidentally) but practically lives on Yosemite’s Dawn Wall. And let’s not forget the shit show that ensued because Brandon Stark couldn’t keep his climbing under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is all this hullabaloo about climbing? Is it for the stoke? For the glory of ascent? For the spectacular shoulders and back muscles that come with multiple variations of a pull up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, no one really has a straightforward answer for why it is they climb. Climbers see a rock, climbers need to touch it – graze over the surface of its face, knock on the tufa to check if it’s hollow, and finger some cracks and holes to discover potential crimps and pockets. (Imagine what that looks like to a non-climber.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last August 18, 2018 was the first ever Global Climbing Day as declared by The North Face. It is a tribute of the seemingly irrational but undoubtedly persistent desire to scale great heights. Local climbers celebrated the day by flocking to Climb Central Manila (CCM) to do what it is they do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were special lectures and demonstrations for the newbies and fun competitions that offered spectacular prizes like limited edition stickers, hydroflasks, and day packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing has only recently been gaining traction in Manila, so it was a pleasant surprise to see a blend of both familiar and unfamiliar faces scaling the walls of CCM on Global Climbing Day. We at Send Magazine were curious as to what it was that brought all these people together that day, so we decided to do some snooping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a few interviews in between sends to figure out what itch these guys were trying to scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Renz&quot; class=&quot;floated-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	RENZ
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: 26 &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: &amp;lt;3 tries 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of world climbing day, Renz had only climbed twice in his life. Once to try it, and another time to try it again. But within those 2 sessions, he already picked up on some important pointers on climbing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, that climbing isn’t just about upper body strength. Climbing is a full body workout that requires lots of grip and complex movements. And second, that it’s not just about strength but also strategy. Climbing requires you to make important decisions, like what are the most efficient moves to us, when to save energy, and when to go all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even as the Brand Executive for The North Face, Renz doesn’t plan to stop climbing just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Can you tell us a bit more about global climbing day?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Basically North Face wants to promote or increase awareness of indoor climbing since it’s not that big of a sport yet in the whole world. TNF initiated a day, which is August 18, 2018, to be the first official Global Climbing Day. Not only is it held in the Philippines- it’s also held worldwide. So we have one simultaneously running in Japan, Thailand, Korea, and other Asian countries. For the US side of things, they’ll be running the Global Climbing Day tomorrow, on August 19. So it’s really the whole world – that’s why we call it Global Climbing Day, not just national climbing day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Have you ever gone climbing before?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A:  When we planned for the Global Climbing Day, the staff of Climb Central were kind enough to let me try out. But that was my first time. It was a new experience. It was a pleasant experience. For me it’s a whole body workout, so that’s one of the best things I can say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: It wasn’t that scary for you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It wasn’t that scary. But I think for the autobelay part I took a while. I was probably at the top most for about 2 minutes because I didn’t know how to go. I thought it would go down fast so I was kind of scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Nico&quot; class=&quot;floated-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Nico
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: 29 &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: &amp;lt;2 years
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nico is what you would call a boulderer, which you might mistakenly think is someone who is built like a boulder &amp;amp;dash; but that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boulderers are those who engage in bouldering, which is a type of climbing that doesn’t require a harness because you don’t climb particularly high. Bouldering is usually a shorter, more powerful, and almost acrobatic style of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nico won third place in the Novice Leg of the Philippine Climbing Nationals in 2018. But when he was just starting out, he once ordered a pair of Five Ten Moccasyms from an online site. At only PHP800, he thought he was striking an excellent deal, but what arrived two weeks later was a fake pair of red Puma shoes. It seems no one showed him the right beta there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How did you get into climbing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: A friend just invited me and I started climbing ever since. From basketball I moved to climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Why did you decide to change sport? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It’s a fun mental sport that you can do either on your own or with your friends. And it challenges you to think while you’re actually on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Why would you say it’s a mental sport? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: There’s always a better way to do a certain route, a certain move. And that can be the difference between falling off and staying on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Buddy&quot; class=&quot;floated-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Buddy
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: ???  &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: ???  &lt;br /&gt;
	Highest climbing grade: 8A+ &lt;br /&gt;
	Highest glasses grade: 400 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t guess by his name, Virgilio Advincula (or Kuya Buddy as he’s fondly referred to in the climbing community), is a veteran climber. While his age and climbing experience are still things of mystery, legend has it that Kuya Buddy has been in the climbing scene since it boomed, mellowed out, and boomed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He considers himself an all-around climber, but is currently focused on lead climbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead climbing is sport-climbing where you clip your rope to quickdraws as you ascend a wall. Some people might consider it scarier than top-rope because the falls tend to be longer. But Kuya Buddy assures you, lead climbing is totally safe as long as you have a trusted belayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: As a veteran competitor, do you have any rituals?  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: A lot! I have to wear my own clothes, the same ones, all over again. The pants. And I always put my tie-in on the left side. If there’s a belay loop, I always put it on the left, because most of the competitions I do is lead. Of course I have to drink the same drink as before, which is gatorade. I always have one bottle of that. And of course I’m wearing my lucky chalk bag and harness. That’s the only ritual I do. And the last is the music. It’s Mamma Mia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Mama Mia! Does it give you strength?  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It puts me in the zone. So if I’m listening to this music, I’m not hearing anyone so I’m just flowing in the music. Because I have to focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Would you recommend climbing to new people? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Definitely! Number one, it’s a whole-body workout. Instead of being a couch potato inside your house, go out and go climbing. It benefits your health. If you finish some walls, it’s a fulfillment for you. And probably after you’ve tried it, you’ll love the sport. It’s been a growing sport all over since 2001. It’s booming right now. I’m really happy about it because I can see new faces every now and then in this gym. I really recommend it. It’s not an extreme sport! It’s a sport that requires flexibility, some patience, and some fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Annemarie&quot; class=&quot;floated-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ANNEMARIE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: 31 &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: &amp;gt;1 time
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August 18, 2018 was Annemarie Gomez’s first time climbing. Ever. As with most people, she suffers from a fear of heights. But instead of keeping her feet planted in the comfort zone that is the floor, she decided to give climbing a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I just had my birthday so, you know, just try something new,”&lt;/em&gt; she said. And that’s exactly what she did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global Climbing Day was the perfect venue to get a sample of the unique thrill only traversing into great heights can give you. She tried sport climbing with top-rope, which is the typical style of climbing that comes to mind to newbies. She also tried bouldering, which is a ropeless form of short, powerful, almost acrobatic climbing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Q: How does it feel doing this when you have a fear of heights?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: It’s really a challenge because I’m afraid to fall down. That’s my biggest fear, falling down. So my thing is, once I look down, I won’t be able to go back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How did it feel after falling down? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Actually, it wasn’t that bad. But falling down was like a rush, but when you get down you’re like ‘oh ok, not that bad.’ I’m excited to try the autobelay because at least it will belay me down automatically and there will be no fear of falling down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: What do you like the most out of what you’ve experienced so far?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Well, actually, the instructors. They’re really patient in teaching the first-timers and the facilities are really nice. It was a seamless registration and coming in here so I like how it was all organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kranz&quot; class=&quot;floated-left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;KRANZ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: 22 &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: 4 years &lt;br /&gt;
	Arch nemesis: Ponchai aka Kranz 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kranz (fondly referred to as “Kranzisco” by his real friends) started climbing 4 years ago in Market Market. He was introduced to the sport by Dennis Diaz who is an alumni of the Mapua University Mountaineering Club, which Kranz is a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kranz is no stranger to competitions, he says he feels more pressure being interviewed than he ever has climbing on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Kranz is a man of few words. But as a member of the Philippine National Climbing Team, perhaps he lets his climbing speak for itself. Here’s an excerpt from the actual interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Hi Kranz, can you tell us about yourself? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: So, what can you say about Ponchai being your nemesis? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Kranz? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/issue-2/gcd/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chelle&quot; class=&quot;floated-right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CHELLE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;subtext&quot;&gt;
	Age: 26 &lt;br /&gt;
	Climbing XP: &amp;gt;3 years &lt;br /&gt;
	Partner-in-climb: Brandon 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelle is living proof that climbing is a gender-neutral sport. In the bouldering gym, you’ll find Chelle working on and crushing all the same problems as the biggest, burliest boys out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons climbing is fantastic is because it doesn’t favor anyone. To climb a wall, you use your advantages, whatever they are. You can use your strength, your flexibility, your cleverness to send a route. In fact, you could even say climbing is more a mental sport than a physical one. Whatever way you send it, it counts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chelle’s strength lies in her sheer power and fearlessness, so it’s no wonder that despite having only three years of climbing experience, she’s a part of Team A in the Philippine National Climbing Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: How did you get started? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: I have a friend who was an instructor in Power Up Centro, so he invited us to climb. So from there I got hooked with my boyfriend Brandon. We started at the same time. We’re climbing partners. And partners in life. Joke – don’t include that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: 3 years and you’re already in the Philippine team! How did that happen? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: In my first year, I was climbing almost three times a week. If you climb regularly, you improve faster. My climbing partner kept wanting to go back. It helps when there’s someone there to motivate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Do you think female climbers can climb as well as male climbers? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: I think that it’s totally possible. The ladies can definitely keep up with the boys, especially now that women are breaking barriers. There are a lot of climbers that can climb as hard as guys can, especially international climbers like Margot Hayes – they’re doing 9As! Back then, people thought it was impossible. But now, it’s really possible. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;emphasis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what did we figure out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everyone can climb, and climbing is for everyone! Why? Because it’s fun. There’s nothing more to it than that. Global Climbing Day is a celebration of the human spirit and our weird impulses to climb mountains, scale great heights, and ventures headlong into our own worst fears in pursuit of a stoke only a send can give.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Climbing is a fantastic sport. The more people climb, the more they infect others with this insatiable urge to just get up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask several founding members of Adventure Central to sit down with me on the second floor cafe of their facility. Below us, we hear the cheers of the crowd as climbers compete during Verticality, one of their annual climbing events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koy, Sha, and Francis are three of the 11-person founding group of Iloilo’s latest rock climbing facility, Adventure Central. The gym was conceptualized right after the closure of Pump Factory, their previous climbing center, of which they were also the stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/ac/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Story: Adventure Central&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pump Factory was a four-wall indoor climbing facility that was also situated along the Iloilo River esplanade. It was a training ground, not only for Iloilo’s top rock climbers, but for the gym owners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Adventure Central is marketed as an outdoor sports center, targeting outdoor sports enthusiasts in general, not just rock climbers. This, they say, is a  very wise move given that climbing is a non-mainstream sport; supplanting the gym with activities such as kayaking tours, mountaineering guideship, and mountain biking events, keeps the facility going and allows it to become a hub for all outdoor enthusiasts in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask them what the most challenging part of running a facility such as Adventure Central is. They answer that dealing with paperwork, being able to retain their climbing gym members, and due to logistics, outdoor climbing are among the most difficult tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Image Row --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;image-row 2&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jops Corpus and Lian Obias from Manila competing in Verticality 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep the number of gym climbers from dwindling, Adventure Central holds climbing activities all throughout the year. They offer a Kids Climbing Competition during summer, an Anniversary Competition in July, and Verticality during the Christmas season. To them, every competition is a gathering, and each time they hold one, they gain more insight on how to run the next one and to keep their business going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop for Adventure Central, they say, is to produce national-caliber climbers. Since most of their climbers are in the age range of 10-20 years old, they aim to train these young aspiring athletes to compete in the national stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/ac/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Story: Adventure Central&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing and business is intertwined in the minds of the people running &lt;a href=&quot;/directory&quot;&gt;Adventure Central&lt;/a&gt;. It is work that needs constant refining in order to keep the business running. According to Sha, it is a give and take relationship with the community that has been built by and supported by this facility. But, she says, Adventure Central is not solely a business; it is also a family, as most other climbing gyms are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Nick Aguilos</name></author><category term="other-articles" /><summary type="html">Along the banks of the Iloilo River is a climbing gym that aims to spread the outdoor sports mentality to a wider audience in Iloilo.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/ac/hero-image.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s in your bag, Yoshi?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/07/19/wiyb-yoshi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What's in your bag, Yoshi?" /><published>2018-07-19T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-07-19T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/07/19/wiyb-yoshi</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/07/19/wiyb-yoshi.html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;pre-text&quot;&gt;
	In this first edition of &lt;em&gt;What's In Your Bag&lt;/em&gt;, we talked to Japanese climber and frequent traveller &lt;strong&gt;Yoshimasa Shiraiwa&lt;/strong&gt; about what he carries in his gym bag. 
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We caught him during one of his visits to Power Up Centro Atletico, and went through the items that he regularly brings to the climbing gym. Since he’s never in one place for too long, we thought that he might have some interesting items with him that he might be able to share with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	BCAA+ G 6000 Muscle Size, Strength and Recovery
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BCAA+ G 6000 Muscle Size, Strength and Recovery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a kind of amino acid that’s good for climbing. It [also] helps with recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Gran’s Remedy 
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BCAA+ G 6000 Muscle Size, Strength and Recovery&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I wear shoes without socks, so in Japan, it’s very popular to prevent smelling. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it like a powder? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we put it in shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Umbrella, Mask
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;umbrella-mask&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
	Note: Most of the time, Yoshi stays in the cheaper inns around the metro; he also walks to the climbing gym to save some pesos during his stays in the country. The mask helps in protecting Yoshi from the smog. 
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you have a mask? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I walk for a long time here in Manila &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, you have asthma? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you like to walk? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; For a change of pace. I think Filipinos don’t like walking. Japanese [people] like more walking so for me, walking is not so special. It’s a kind of exercise. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How many kilometers is it from here to your house? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe eight kilometers.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How long does it take you to walk? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe two hours &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t get bored? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; No, my hobby is walking. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Here in Manila, have you seen anything new while walking? Anything interesting? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; The scenery in general is very interesting. It’s much different from Japan, especially Malacanang or Sta. Mesa or something. Ermita is also very different. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Phone case (PX360 Made For Life)
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;phonecase&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; This is for mountaineering, you can clip it to your harness. But this is already discontinued. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it waterproof? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; No, but it’s very shockproof. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you bring a laptop when you travel? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Nope, just my phones &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you have two phones? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; iPhone is very nice for photos, but it’s very expensive. Sometimes in dangerous areas, it’s not a good idea to use this one. So for example, in Manila, I use the cheaper phone.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you use your phone in climbing, for example, when you research where to go? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the first time I came to Manila, I searched for climbing gyms in Manila. I’m lucky because I met Ate Jhe here (in Centro Atletico) But I went to all gyms in Manila–Market Market, Power Up R.O.X., Power Up Tandang Sora, and Climb Central Manila. But I like it here.  I met Ate Jhe and Ikay. I forgot to ask for a telephone number so I thought I couldn’t get in contact with them anymore. But I remembered the name of Erika (Ikay) because Erika is also a Japanese name. And I searched Erika on Facebook and found her so I could get in contact with Ate Jhe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Happy story! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, happy story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Oakley Shades
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;shades&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Yoshi, why do you always wear shades? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Long story, okay? Originally I am a mountaineer. And when you climb mountains, you need sunglasses (because of the sun). So I bought this one, because it’s very durable. If you let it fall from a high place, it doesn’t break. Actually, I dropped it from the final pitch of a multi pitch, but it didn’t break. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How high was it? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Six pitches. Now I don’t climb mountains anymore, so I just use it for climbing. But it doesn’t break, so I continue using this one. Everyone’s always asking me why even when it’s night, I continue wearing sunglasses. That’s the reason. Maybe next time I’ll buy the same one, but with more clear lenses. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; So it’s not too dark even if it’s night and you’re wearing shades? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; No, well, actually, I have gotten accustomed to sunglasses, but it’s not so dark anyway. Under the sun, you can see my eyes, so actually it’s not so dark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	5.10 samurai t-shirt from Japan
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tshirt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you like that shirt? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I like this design, and it’s kind of old. [I bought it] maybe 10 years before and I have never seen another person wearing this recently, so it’s unique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Patagonia R2 Fleece Jacket
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fleece&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I study in Starbucks, but Starbucks is too cold, so I bring this jacket. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you study in Starbucks? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Tagalog.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Simple Wallet &amp;amp; Keys
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wallet-keys&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I bought this in Manila, someone told me, if you have this kind of wallet, you are safe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Why will you be safe? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know. I bought it in a stall on the road. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Toothbrushes
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you have three toothbrushes? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; They’re for Kota Kinabalu &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh! You’re going to Kota Kinabalu? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup! Here it’s a city, but in Kota Kinabalu, it’s not a big city, so I might not be able to find toothbrushes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Patagonia Cragsmith 35L
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;backpack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you get this? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Last year, November? My old backpack was broken. It’s very nice for climbing and travelling. It’s 35L but it contains more than 35L, I think. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you like about this bag? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; This size is suitable for bringing it into airplanes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; But you have another bag for your clothes? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, but when I go to Malaysia and Thailand, [I’m bringing] only this. I’m leaving my other bag here because it’s heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Daiso bag
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;daiso-bag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I bought this bag from Daiso in Japan. I like simple bags. But our housekeeper laughs at me because in this country, this type of bag is for shopping in the supermarket; men never have this bag, I don’t know. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; So what do you put in there? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; This is for climbing harness and shoes and chalk bag. I usually bring this bag to Centro because it doesn’t look expensive. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; You have another canvas bag, right? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, but for my studying things. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you practice sometimes when you’re here in Centro? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Here? No, I study in the morning and early in the afternoon and after that I come here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; What was your bag before? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; The North Face but not for free climbing; it was for alpine climbing.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How was it different? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; It can hold an ice axe, because I also did ice climbing. That bag was very nice for alpine climbing. But I don’t need it anymore, so it’s okay. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How long did you have that bag for? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, it was easy to break, maybe two years? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Lime Chalk Bag
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chalkbag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you buy your chalk bag? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; 2016, last last year during Lust for Lime. I really like it. It’s very rare in Japan because no one has Lime. So sometimes, I’m asked, “What is Lime?” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	ATC-XP &amp;amp; Black Diamond Carabiner
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;carabiner-tube&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; The pear shape prevents cross load. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How long have you had it for? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe five years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Black Diamond Momentum Double Speed
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;carabiner-tube&quot; /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; What about your harness, where’s it from? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s from BD (Black Diamond) &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you had it for a long time? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s my fourth harness. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; How long have you been climbing? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost 10 years. Recently, I’ve been dedicated especially to indoor climbing. But before, I liked trad climbing. In trad climbing, sometimes you have to climb chimneys or offwidths so it’s easy to break the harness. But recently I’ve only been sport climbing, so it’s okay.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	La Sportiva Skwama
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/issue-1/wiyb/14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;shoes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; I like this one so much because it’s [a] very nice [pair of] shoes and it fits my foot shape. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt;  What were your previous shoes? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Miura. It is very suitable for trad climbing and also sport climbing, but this one is better; with overhanging route, it’s easier. It’s just not good for slabs (because of the downturn). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it comfortable? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, very comfortable. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Those are your favorite shoes from everything you’ve tried before? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I actually have six Skwamas. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Whoa! When you buy new shoes, you like to buy Skwamas again? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I have a plan to buy three [more] Skwamas because I climb so much and my weight is very heavy (they get worn out easily). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; Have your previous Skwamas broken already? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; No, they’re on rotation. If they’re wearing out, I bring the shoes to the resole company. I only have one Skwama that is not yet worn out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send:&lt;/strong&gt; When you buy gear for mountaineering or sport climbing, what do you look for? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Yoshi:&lt;/strong&gt; Recently, [I’ve been looking at] function for climbing gear. For example, for quickdraw I bought it for ice climbing and free climbing because it is easy to unclip and [it is] very light. So I chose this but now I shifted to more sport climbing so I have more options. So I think I will buy another one now because I choose climbing gear by the function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to try rock climbing but don’t know where to start? Worry not, this article has all you need to know in order to begin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing is a unique sport that is not just physically challenging but mentally demanding as well. Since it requires problem-solving skills in order to properly scale the wall, it is definitely a full-body workout that will guarantee you hours well-spent getting stronger and releasing stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-choose-a-gym&quot;&gt;Step 1: Choose a gym.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the rise in popularity of the sport, there have been many gyms that have opened in different places around the city. Simply choose a gym that is convenient for you to visit, and know how to get there and what their operating hours are. &lt;a href=&quot;/directory&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to our climbing directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-invite-a-friend-to-climb-with-you&quot;&gt;Step 2: Invite a friend to climb with you.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing normally requires two people; one would be climbing the wall while the other would be belaying, or handling the ropes of the climber. If you’re starting out, it would be best to bring at least a friend with you so that you can get a feel of the sport and get to practice belaying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3-show-up&quot;&gt;Step 3: Show up!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get to the gym, register at the counter, pay, and meet the instructor/s. They will teach you the basics of how to belay, the safety signals, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gym, you will see that the walls have holds of different colors. Often, a color represents a route to be climbed; these routes vary in difficulty. However, for beginners, it is recommended that you don’t limit yourself to the colors, and simply get a feel of climbing the wall. The more often you visit the gym, the more you get used to the feel of climbing and the stronger you become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to wear comfortable clothes and to bring a water jug to hydrate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-rent-equipment&quot;&gt;Step 4: Rent equipment.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main equipment needed for climbing include climbing harnesses and shoes; the former is required for top-rope climbing and can be rented in the gym, the latter is not required but would greatly help in climbing as it clings onto even the smallest of holds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-5-have-fun&quot;&gt;Step 5: Have fun!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing exercises not only the body but also the mind. It teaches you to move beyond your comfort zone all while having so much fun. Get out there and climb a wall!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Cindy McSender</name></author><category term="other-articles" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/starter-kit/1.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">National Bouldering Competitions 2018</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/20/nationals.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="National Bouldering Competitions 2018" /><published>2018-04-20T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-04-20T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/04/20/nationals</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/04/20/nationals.html">&lt;p&gt;Tensions ran high as local and international climbers vied for a spot in the podium during the R.O.X. Zero Gravity International Bouldering Competition 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Held last May 19 and 20, the competition featured six categories: Youth Men’s, Youth Women’s, Novice Men’s, Novice Women’s, Open Men’s, and Open Women’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marked the return of an R.O.X. climbing competition, after its apparent absence last year; this year’s competition featured a change in format, as the previous competition in 2016 followed a lead climbing competition format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though more than a hundred climbers registered to join, only the top six climbers of each category advanced to the finals after the qualifiers, in which the competitors were ranked by the number of boulder problems they were able to top, and the number of zones they were able to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally, after a fierce competition between the climbers, the winners were finally declared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elissa Alexandre Vidal for Youth Women’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Justin Andrei Perjis for Youth Men’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saihlene Morata for Novice Women’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Benjamin V. Tabios for Novice Men’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Widia Fujiyanti for Open Women’s&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seto for Open Men’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
