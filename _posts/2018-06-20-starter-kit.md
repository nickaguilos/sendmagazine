Want to try rock climbing but don’t know where to start? Worry not, this article ___ you!

Climbing is a unique sport that requires not only skills but problem-solving skills as well. It is also a full body workout that will guarantee you  (description of climbing that would entice reader to try it out?)

### Step 1: Choose a gym.
 
Since the rise in popularity of the sport, there have been many gyms that have opened in different places around the city. Simply choose a gym that is convenient for you to visit, and know how to get there and what their operating hours are. Here (link) is a link to our climbing directory.

### Step 2: Invite a friend to climb with you.

Climbing normally requires two people; one would be climbing the wall while the other would be belaying, or handling the ropes of the climber. If you’re starting out, it would be best to bring at least a friend with you so that you can get a feel of the sport and get to practice belaying.

### Step 3: Show up!

When you get to the gym, register at the counter, pay, and meet the instructor/s. They will teach you the basics of how to belay, the safety signals, etc.

In the gym, you will see that the walls have holds of different colors. Often, a color represents a route to be climbed; these routes vary in difficulty. However, for beginners, it is recommended that you don’t limit yourself to the colors, and simply get a feel of climbing the wall. The more often you visit the gym, the more you get used to the feel of climbing and the stronger you become.

Don’t forget to wear comfortable clothes and to bring a water jug to hydrate yourself.

### Step 4: Rent equipment.

The main equipment needed for climbing include climbing harnesses and shoes; the former is required for top-rope climbing and can be rented in the gym, the latter is not required but would greatly help in climbing it clings onto even the smallest of holds.

### Step 5: Have fun!

Climbing exercises not only the body but also the mind. It teaches you to move beyond your comfort zone all while having so much fun. Get out there and climb a wall!
