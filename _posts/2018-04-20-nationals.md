Tensions ran high as local and international climbers vied for a spot in the podium during the R.O.X. Zero Gravity International Bouldering Competition 2018. 

Held last May 19 and 20, the competition featured six categories: Youth Men’s, Youth Women’s, Novice Men’s, Novice Women’s, Open Men’s, and Open Women’s.

This marked the return of an R.O.X. climbing competition, after its apparent absence last year; this year’s competition featured a change in format, as the previous competition in 2016 followed a lead climbing competition format.

Though more than a hundred climbers registered to join, only the top six climbers of each category advanced to the finals after the qualifiers, in which the competitors were ranked by the number of boulder problems they were able to top, and the number of zones they were able to reach. 

But finally, after a fierce competition between the climbers, the winners were finally declared: 
- Elissa Alexandre Vidal for Youth Women’s
- Justin Andrei Perjis for Youth Men’s
- Saihlene Morata for Novice Women’s 
- Matthew Benjamin V. Tabios for Novice Men’s 
- Widia Fujiyanti for Open Women’s 
- Seto for Open Men’s
