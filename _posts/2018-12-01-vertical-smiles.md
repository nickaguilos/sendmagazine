Climbing gyms and communities. Words that must always be paired. Like Adam and Eve, fries and ketchup, Lone Ranger and Tonto. By its very nature, climbing is a very social sport. More often than not, we head to the crags and gyms accompanied by our bestest friends, who are also our belayers, moral supporters, and drinking buddies.

Without the support of a community, a climbing gym will slowly deteriorate and find itself closing doors. 

I recall a conversation with Jezrel Soriaso (aka <em>Papsy</em>), one of the owners of the gym, that the facility was in a slump. Power Up Rock Outdoor Center was struggling to grow it’s community. This took me by surprise as Adventure Central, a gym just across the channel, was thriving and had a sheer number of climbers on a daily basis.

Bacolod’s climbers rallied together to bring attention to its gym, their home. In early December of 2018, I flew to the city of smiles to witness Power Up ROC’s Vertical Smiles Climbing Competition. The first climbing competition held in this gym in a while.

Zai Barrido was the point person for Vertical Smiles. She reiterates that the main goal of the gym was to expose climbing to a wider audience in Bacolod, and in effect, bring more climbers into the gym. She jokingly mentions the hurdles they had to go through to get this competition up and running: sponsorships, logistics, etc..

The good thing about the pinoy climbing community is the amount of support we give to each other, expecting little to nothing in return. 64 participants registered for the event, many of those registered just to support, and had no intention in competing.

There was a massive contigent from Iloilo, who were mostly comprised by their junior climbers. There were climbers from Cebu, Dumaguete, as well as, Manila.

Vertical Smiles lasted way into the night and was capped with food, drinks, and conversations. Comps are 50% athleticism and 50% gatherings after all.

Zai mentioned that proceeds from the competition would be used to fund the wall repainting jobs, purchasing of new holds, and community funds for new climbing hardware.

This competition has breathed new life into an aging climbing gym in the Visayas. Sometimes it has become standard to say an event was a success if the reality was otherwise. This time around it definitely was.
