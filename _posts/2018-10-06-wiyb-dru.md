<h3>North Face Duffel Bag in Medium</h3>

<strong>Dru:</strong> I got it because it’s the biggest size that I can bring as hand carry <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> They don't measure it by weight? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Also by weight but in terms of dimensions, ito yung maximum na dimensions yata. Pero by weight parang 7 kilos ata. Sometimes when I travel, it’s not really that full and then when I go back, I check it in and then it’s full, or then mabigat sya <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> How long have you had it for? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Around two years <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> It’s mostly your crag bag? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Yes, because it’s comfortable and it’s really easy to get stuff out of it. I used to hike and mountaineering bags tend to be narrow so you need to dig in. <br>


![Climbing Shoes]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/2.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Shoes</h3>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Okay, let’s start from most important to least important. Most important, shoes. I have two pairs of shoes pag lead climbing because I have a loose pair which is just for warming up and endurance routes. Then I have an aggressive pair for projects or redpointing. So, two pairs of shoes.

<strong>Send:</strong> What are your shoes? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> So, yung loose pair is <em>Climb X</em>, I don’t know what model. But I got this when there were no other shoes available a few years ago. <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Okay naman sya like okay naman yung performance nya. Parang malapit sa Anasazi yung shape nya. <em>Resoled na ‘to, na shamir na ‘to</em>. So it’s not anything special. It’s like a workhorse na shoe. <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Then the other shoe is my favorite shoe. It’s the 5.10 Arrowhead. It’s pretty aggressive. Actually pinabili ko ‘to sa Canada on sale and I bought two pairs.

<h3>Lime Chalk Bag</h3>

<strong>Dru:</strong> I have my lime chalk bag. I changed the strap to a cord. It’s more for emergencies. If I need to anchor or if ineed a prusik in the middle of the climb, then I can just take off the chalkbag and use the cord for emergencies.

![Climbing Harness]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/4.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Black Diamond Momentum</h3>

<strong>Dru:</strong> Then, syempre harness. My harness is overdue. <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> What do you mean, like it’s really old? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> I have to replace it this year. <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> How do you say that you wanan replace it, does it feel or look different? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> usually the manufacturer says five years. It depends on the manufacturer, but usually five years ung shelf life nya even if you’re not using it. And it’s also starting to rust.. Yung non-critical parts naman, buckles and stuff na hindi naman load bearing. <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> When I bought this I was just starting to get back into climbing <br>
<strong>Send:</strong> You stoppped climbing? <br>
<strong>Dru:</strong> Yeah I started again mga 3 and a half years ago. 3, 4 years ago <br>


<div class="emphasis">
	<strong>Send</strong>: Why’d you stop? <br>
	<strong>Dru</strong>: A lot of reasons. I never really stop stopped; like I would still climb every so often but I didn’t take it serious for a while. Medyo nag decline yung climbing in general, like they stopped having competitions.  <br>

	I started competing really early. I started climbing at 11, then I started competing at 12. Competitions were all that I knew before. Hindi naman uso mag outdoor dati kung hindi ka mountaineer or hardcore &ndash; it wasn’t as accessible before. So when the competitions stopped, I lost my motivation. <br>

	At the same time even when they were still going, I wasn’t wining. I wasn’t on the trajectory that I wanted to be.

![Coffee]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/5.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Coffee</h3>

<strong>Dru</strong>: Coffee. Always have coffee. I was gonna say belay device, but pwede namang humiram ng belay device. <br>
<strong>Send</strong>: Coffee is an essential <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>: So, it’s <em>Contigo</em>. I like Contigo kasi aside from the button that you have to press to drink, you can lock it. So when it’s in your bag, you lock it and then it won’t accidentally get pressed. <br> Then it’s also double walled, so parang Kleen Kanteen but not as good. Kasi like the body is the same as Kleen Kanteen but then the top I guess mas madedeciminate nya yung init from the top because it’s thinner than a Kleen Kanteen.

<h3>First Aid Kit</h3>

<strong>Dru</strong>:I also always usually have a first aid kit. It contains various medicines. It contains hydrite. It contains alcohol. It’s actually a first aid slash kikay kit so ayun, may sunblock and <em>Off</em> and then nail cutter and scissors and what else? The usual stuff: Betadyne, bandages, lighter... <br>
<strong>Send</strong>: What’s the Chinese meds? <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>:  This is like Chinese Bioflu because I just came back from china and I got sick and I ran out of Bioflu. 


![Belay Device]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/7.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Belay Device</h3>

<strong>Send</strong>: Is that your belay device? <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>: Yup! <em>Edelrid Mega Jul</em>. So far it’s the most versatile belay device I've had because it’s assisted, and it’s also a tube device.

![Personal Anchor System]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/8.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Metolius Personal Anchor System</h3>

<strong>Dru</strong>: This is my pas (personal anchor system). Very useful and versatile because each loop is supposed to be as strong as your belay loop. It’s stronger than a daisy chain, and more reliable. Even if you only have one anchored, it’s supposed to be good enough, not like a daisy chain or sling na dapat dalawa or tatlo. So this one, you can use the same chain and  then anchor it on two points and it’ll be strong enough. <br>
<strong>Send</strong>: What do you use that for? <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>: Pag normal crag day, usually for retrieving but it’s also good for multi-pitching, for bolting, and for routesetting. 

![Quickdraws]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/9.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>Quikdraws</h3>

<strong>Dru</strong>: Quickdraws, came from monkey wall so I brought all 22 quickdraws. <br>
<strong>Send</strong>: 22! <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>: yeah, becase the routes are really long there. This is Posiwire, then Positron. Then I have a set of 10 that are really, really old so I replaced the runners. So this is actually Black Diamond. I’ve had these for 10 years, but I bought them second hand. <br>
I replaced the runners with Petzl Spirit, kasi the biners you can use them indefinitely but the runners parang harness lang na you have to replace it even if you’re not using it.

![Hat]({{ 'assets/images/issue-2/wiyb-dru/10.jpg' | absolute_url }})
<h3>The North Face Hat &amp; an Umbrella</h3>

<strong>Dru</strong>: Wide rim hat. Monkey wall is a really sunny crag so it’s nice to have a wide rim hat. It’s useful if you really have to belay under the sun. <br>
<strong>Dru</strong>: Umbrella. I usually have an umbrella it’s useful for hiking, for the rain, for the sun, for belaying.
